Doing this project I learned a ton. In no particular order, I learned:

Google has pretty good documentation, but their methods and locations for storing info isn't always straightforward
Event listeners are pretty handy and not too bad to use
Dynamically making divs and filling them with content is relatively easy once template strings are set up
Testing for edge cases (for previous and next chapter in this project) are important, and setting break points and stepping
	into functions is very helpful
Splitting up complex functions into smaller functions can be annoying, but is helpful for when they needed to be called in
	different instances
Constants are helpful when it's important to document where variables are coming from and when dealing with long, annoying
	strings or regex
JavaScript is not as scary as I initially thought it was when starting this class
Ugly websites may have amazing code behind them, and pretty website make have terrible code behind them. Styling can shape
	impressions even when it may not be an accurate representation of the quality of the site/company/product
People have likely already done what you are trying to do, so the internet is your friend. In this project I didn't copy
	code directly from many places, but the internet is a great resource to see how to properly use methods in creative
	and powerful ways. We didn't have to get too crazy in this project, fortunately
There's always many ways to code something that will do the same thing. Readability may be better than length in some cases

What I've accomplished:
The requirements of this project
Gained a much better understanding of javascript
Gained more confidence in programming in JS and combining it with manipulation of the DOM/HTML
Made prev and next buttons that will appear when needed and disappear when not needed
